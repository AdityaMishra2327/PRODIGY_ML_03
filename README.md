## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes labeled images of cats and dogs. The dataset is used for training and testing the image classification model.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for developing the classification model.
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: For image processing and feature extraction.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training progress and results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cat-dog-image-classification.git
    cd cat-dog-image-classification
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**:
    - Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the appropriate directory.
    - Load and preprocess the images for training and testing.

2. **Model Training**:
    - Use OpenCV (cv2) to process and extract features from images.
    - Train a classification model using the extracted features.
    - Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.

3. **Evaluation**:
    - Assess the model's accuracy and performance using evaluation metrics.

## Data Preprocessing

- **Image Resizing**: Resized images to a consistent size suitable for feature extraction.
- **Normalization**: Scaled pixel values to the range [0, 1] for improved model performance.
- **Feature Extraction**: Used OpenCV (cv2) to extract relevant features from images.

## Model Training

- **Model Approach**: Developed a classification model based on features extracted using OpenCV (cv2).
- **Training Process**: Trained the model on the dataset and fine-tuned parameters to improve performance.

## Results

- **Model Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of 55% on the test dataset.
- **Performance Insights**: The model demonstrated basic classification capabilities, with potential for further improvement.

## Conclusion

This project provided a valuable learning experience in image classification and feature extraction using OpenCV (cv2). The knowledge gained in data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training will be useful for future machine learning projects.

## Future Work

- **Model Improvement**: Experiment with more advanced feature extraction techniques and classification algorithms for improved accuracy.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters to enhance performance.
- **Data Augmentation**: Increase the diversity of the training data to improve generalization.
